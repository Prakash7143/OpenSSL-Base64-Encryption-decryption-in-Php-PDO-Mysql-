Import the "phpsecurity" mysql database.
Open the project in your browser while moving it into "htdocs" or "www" directory.

Here we are encrypting all form values including image and PDF file objects. Storing, retrieving and updating in the database using Php's PDO way and Ajax.

For encryption, decryption we are using php's openssl_cipher.

Happy Coding....
Thanks...
